# 1C.
## Output of print("127","0","0","1",sep=".") = 127.0.0.1

# 1D.
## If you are coding for a real-time or an interactive purpose, you would use flush=True. For example, in the situation that you are coding to obtain log messages at each timepoint of 5 min increments for 30 minutes and each log message contains information needed for the next timepoint. It would be crucial to use flush=True so you can see messages at each time point and proceed accordingly for the next time point. 
## If it's not a real-time or interactive purpose, you can use flush=False. In the previous example, if you just need the log message at each 5 min increments but necessarily required information for the next timepoint, you could receive the log messages in bulk. 

# 1E. 
## flush=True is the keyword argument to trigger flush. 

# Challenges
## One challenge I faced wa figuring out how to print all of 1B in one. I am still unsure if that was the most effective method.
